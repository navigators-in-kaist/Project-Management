## 2. What we build

### Project Name
- Trailblazer

### Project Goal
> Allow students to select a starting point and destination within the school campus.
>
> It will display the `shortest route` along with the `estimated time` of arrival.

### Difference from Prev. Maps
> The difference from the existing map service is that it is possible to search through `information inside the school building`.

> e.g. We can find the path from N1 to E3 using Google Map, Naver Map, etc.
>       
> But, we CANNOT find the path from N1 to E3 1339 meeting room.
